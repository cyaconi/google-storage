### TODO
* Example for creating a new bucket
* Example for setting/getting bucket ACL
* Example for setting/getting object ACL
* Section on how to setup a GS account for development or running the 
  project's tests.

Note on Patches/Pull Requests
----------------------------- 
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
